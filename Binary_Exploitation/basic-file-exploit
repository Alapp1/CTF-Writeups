This challenge was called "basic-file-exploit" off of picoCTF: https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/252?category=6&difficulty=2&page=2

For this challenge, the user connected to a server via netcat. The user is prompted with multiple options of actions to do. Inputting "1" allows a user to store data into the database, "2" echoes an entry back to the user based on an index, and "3" exits the program. Starting with "2" just tells the user that no entries have been stored yet.

I used option "1" to input data, and typed "Spencer" as the data I want to store. It asks for the length of the data, so I used 7 so there was no room for a null terminator (just as a thought). After logging my data, I used the "2" option to echo my data back, and used "1" as the "entry number of my data", since that was the first entry. This echoed back "Spencer". 

I wondered if the program didn't check index boundaries, so I exited and tried the same thing but used "0" as my entry number instead, and the flag was returned. This happened because the boundaries of the indexes were not properly checked.

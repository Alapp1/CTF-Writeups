This challenge involves entering an address into stdin, read in by scanf. The obvious choice upon analyzing the source code is to jump to the win function, which prints the flag. Using ghidra to dissassemble the binary into assembly code, we can see the address of this win function. However, PIE is enabled, so we cannot use the absolute address. Instead, we must manually calculate the offset from main to the win function, then use this offset in conjunction with the address of main we are given when we netcat into the server. The address of main given by ghidra is 0x10133d and the address of win is 0x1012a7. This yields an offset of 0x96, by computing 0x10133d - 0x1012a7. By computing the address of main (in my case this was 0x649eab81733d) - 0x96, we get the absolute address of win (0x649EAB8172A7). By entering this into stdin, the flag was printed.

This is a CTF write up for the PICO CTF web exploit challenge "n0s4n1ty 1".

-- SETUP --
In the challenge description they first start out by telling you that there was a problem in the file upload implementation on their website. 
Besides that, the biggest hint they gave was that the file was in the /root directory.

-- ACTION --
Once on the website you are greeted with a simple interface of a profile picture preview, an upload file button, and another to initiate the action of uploading the file.

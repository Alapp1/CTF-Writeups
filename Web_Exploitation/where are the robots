where are the robots

I feel as if I would be doing something wrong for not going directly into this URL with a challenge name that says 'robots':

https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/robots.txt

Gives us the following output****************

User-agent: *
Disallow: /1bb4c.html

************************************************

So I changed the url path to this

https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/1bb4c.html

And VOILA the flag.

Difficulty: VERY EASY
Lessons learned: "User-agent: *"  means that the robots.txt file applies to all robots.
